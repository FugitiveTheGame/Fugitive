Goal of the game:
-----------------

There are two teams in Fugitive:
	- Cops
	- Fugitives


As a Cop:
Your goal is to capture the Fugitives by touching them.
You will have the advantage of a car which you can use to patrol the map,
and quickly pick up and drop off your fellow cops. But be careful to not
leave your car unattended, after unlocking the car the first time, anyone
can get in and drive it.


As a Fugitive:
Your goal is to get to the safe zone at the end of the map without being seen.
If a Cop catches up to you and tags you, you'll be frozen in place.
Another Fugitive can come and touch you to unfreeze you. If you make it to the safe zone,
just sit tight, no one can capture you in the safe zone!
